# TritonUAS
Graduate club at UC-San Diego which specializes in the design and construction of a unmanned aerial vehicle.
This program is for optimizing the design of aircraft using simple optimization techniques. The initial intended purpose for this program is to opimize a 
UAV design that can be manufactured by the undergraduate students of Triton Unmanned Aerial Systems (Triton UAS), a student project-team at UCSD, to use in 
the SUAS competition hosted by the AUVSI Seafarer Chapter.
